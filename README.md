# ThinkStream-
ThinkStream — A Simple Web Interface for Local LLMs
A tool for communicating with language models running via LM Studio or Ollama within your local network. It detects and displays the model's "reasoning" process, if provided.

Features
💭 Model thinking visualization
If the model uses reasoning, it is automatically displayed in real-time within separate collapsible blocks. You can expand them to see how the model arrived at its answer.

⚡ Real-time interaction
Responses are delivered as they are generated (streaming), so you don’t have to wait for the complete answer.

🔒 Local and private
Everything runs inside your network. Your data never leaves your system, even if you use models with sensitive information.

✨ Minimalist design
A clean interface without unnecessary elements. Auto-scaling input fields, smooth animations, and adaptive layout.
